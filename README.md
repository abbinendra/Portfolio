## Description

This is a personal portfolio website built with **React** to showcase my projects, skills, and contact information in a clean and organized manner.  
The main objective was to learn how to structure a React application using reusable components and render data dynamically using the `map()` function.  
The project emphasizes modular design, responsiveness, and a smooth user experience across devices.

## Features

- **Modular Component Structure**: The site is divided into multiple reusable components like Header, About, Projects, and Contact for better code organization.
- **Dynamic Rendering with `map()`**: Sections such as projects are generated dynamically from a centralized data file for scalability and easy updates.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts gracefully to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern UI**: Simple and modern interface with visual hierarchy and clean typography.
- **Contact Section**: Includes a functional contact form powered by [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co) for collecting messages directly to email.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building interactive user interfaces using components.
- **JavaScript**: For logic and dynamic data rendering.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsiveness.
- **HTML**: For page structure and markup.
